## Player Stats Card

Stats card component to function and display accurately in Chrome and Firefox.

I use plain HTML, CSS produced using SASS, and vanilla JS.

# Requirements

Node.js installed on your computer.
A package manager such as npm .

# Run application

-1 The project dependencies installed by running npm install in the project directory `npm install`

-2 The live-server npm package to run the application locally. Install it by running `npm install -g live-server`

-3 Open a new terminal and run: `npm run sass`
The sass npm package to compile SCSS styles to CSS.
Every style changed in sass folder will automatically they will be compressed to css/styles.css
All the styles for this application are in the `sass/layout_container.scss` file.
There are multiple sass folders just for Future reuse and extension of code.

-4 Run the application. Install it by running `npm start`
Or if you have live-server extension in your IDE, you can run the application by clicking on the icon.
And the last resort you can run the application by opening the index.html file in the browser.
