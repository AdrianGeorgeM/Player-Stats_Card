## 🏋️ Challenges & Achievements 🎖️

The journey of developing Player Stats Card, though thrilling, presented several challenges. Overcoming these obstacles led to significant achievements and substantial learning experiences:

Dynamic UI Rendering: Creating a dynamic user interface for each stats card and managing the rendering of stats was an initial challenge. This was overcome by effectively using JavaScript's functionality, resulting in an engaging and interactive UI.

Data Handling: Fetching and managing JSON data for front-end construction was a challenge. Efficiently extracting and manipulating this data for use within the card allowed me to simulate live data interaction.

Image Handling: Dynamically updating player images based on the selected player was a challenge. This was achieved by creating a reusable function that handles image updates.

Styling & Animation: Player Stats Card's aesthetic appeal and interactivity were achieved through meticulous styling. I employed SASS as my primary styling tool to ensure styles are contained to their respective components, thereby avoiding conflicts. 

Code Organization and Quality: Maintaining a high-quality codebase free from console errors or warnings was a challenge I overcame through continuous code reviews and testing, ensuring a clean console and a reliable application.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

Player Stats Card is powered by HTML, CSS (SASS), and vanilla JavaScript, offering a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly application:

Styling: I used SASS for styling needs, ensuring component-specific styles. The SASS files are organized into multiple folders and files based on components and layouts for maintainability.

No External Libraries: To maintain a lean and self-contained application, Player Stats Card avoids the use of external libraries.

Clean Code: I've maintained Player Stats Card's codebase to avoid producing any errors in the console, ensuring a reliable and robust application.
